# BSc Thesis: Subject-specific Optimization of Equalizer Band Gains in Auditory Brain-Computer Interfaces

This repository contains the newly introduced Python modules from my Bachelor's thesis. While initially designed to function within the refactored Python version of the aphasia rehabilitation codebase used by Simon Kojima et al. (2024), the modules should function with any auditory stimuli presented through PyAudio. The current classification pipeline uses XDF files as input, but could easily be edited to incorporate EEG files.
